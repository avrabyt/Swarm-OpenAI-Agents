### What is Swarm?
Swarm is an educational framework for lightweight multi-agent orchestration. Built by the OpenAI Solutions team, it simplifies the complex world of multi-agent behavior‚Äîthink fewer large prompts, seamless function calling, and less struggle.

### Key Concepts:
- Routines/Agents
- Hand-offs

![Example Handoff](https://media.beehiiv.com/cdn-cgi/image/fit=scale-down,format=auto,onerror=redirect,quality=80/uploads/asset/file/77f3ce90-fafe-4605-99e3-a4fc9787995f/image.png?t=1729336269)

This ‚Äúhandoff‚Äù between agents is what makes Swarm powerful. Each agent focuses on what it does best and passes tasks to the next agent when needed‚Äîefficient, simple, and collaborative.
